# GitHub Packages

GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. Support Npm, Nuget, Maven, Gradle, RubyGems, Docker.

- GitHub's APIs, GitHub Actions, and webhooks 

## Package vs. Container Registry

Github Container Registry is desgined for container images


# Concept

- [Package registry]: A package registry is a centralized, versioned repository for software components (packages) and their metadata, acting as a library where developers can find, store, and share reusable code, ensuring easy installation, dependency management, and secure supply chains for projects like npm for JavaScript, Maven for Java, or PyPI for Python. It's a key part of software development, allowing teams to manage dependencies and distribute their own private or public packages. 


## Docker

What is Docker? Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

# Terminology

- GitHub Container Regisry (GHCR): The Container registry stores container images within your organization or personal account, and allows you to associate an image with a repository.

- PAT (Personal Access Token)

- Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.
